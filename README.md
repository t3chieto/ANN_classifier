# Churn Prediction using ANN

This is a simple project where I built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn.  
It uses a basic dataset and classifies whether a customer will leave or stay.  
Built using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.  
Just a practice project to learn ANN and binary classification.
